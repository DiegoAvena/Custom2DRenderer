# Custom2DRenderer

A script that extends from 2DRenderer in an attempt to save changes made that are needed to allow for 
RenderFeatures to work with 2DRenderers in the Universal Rendering Pipeline, as suggested by this post: https://github.com/InitialPrefabs/UGUIDots/issues/44

NOTE:
Currently has reference errors, and does not compile as a result.

ALSO NOTE: This script was originally written by Unity, the only change made to it is the name of the class, and the snipped I added that was taken from the link mentioned before.
